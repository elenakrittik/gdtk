# gdtk

Planned features:
- [ ] Formatter (`gdtk format`) (WIP)
- [ ] Linter (`gdtk lint`) (TBD)
- [ ] Project and dependecy manager (multiple commands) (TBD)
- - [ ] Might also include support for GPM.

~~Parser and other low-level stuff will be written in V to be more faster,
while Python will be used to provide beatiful command-line interface.~~
EVERYTHING WILL BE WRITTEN IN RUST

Greatly inspired by these projects:
- Pawel Lampe's [godot-gdscript-toolkit](https;//github.com/Scony/godot-gdscriot-toolkit)
- Paul Hocker's [gs-project-manager](https://gitlab.com/godot-stuff/gs-project-manager/)
