Planned features:
- [ ] Formatter (`gdtk format`) (WIP)
- [ ] Linter (`gdtk lint`) (TBD)
- [ ] Project and dependecy manager (multiple commands) (TBD)

Inline basic annotated code is not supported.
If possible, add empty parentheses to your annotation
or place code on the next line after the annotation.
