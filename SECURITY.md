# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We aim to support all reasonably up-to-date versions of `gdtk` and Godot.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, go to the "Security" tab on `gdtk`'s GitHub repository page, press "Report a vulnerability"
and there describe it in as much detail as possible. We will reply ASAP and will work with you towards an optimal solution.
